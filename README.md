# TokenTutor

## Project Description

TokenTutor is a revolutionary decentralized education platform that connects students with qualified tutors using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments. The platform eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and ensures transparent, secure transactions between educational service providers and learners.

Built on Ethereum blockchain, TokenTutor leverages smart contracts to automate the entire tutoring process - from tutor registration and session booking to payment processing and rating systems. Students can discover tutors, book sessions, and pay directly with cryptocurrency, while tutors receive immediate payment upon session completion.

## Project Vision

- **Eliminate Geographic Barriers**: Connect students and tutors globally without traditional banking limitations
- **Reduce Transaction Costs**: Minimize fees through blockchain automation and eliminate payment processing intermediaries  
- **Ensure Payment Security**: Guarantee tutors receive payment for completed sessions through smart contract escrow
- **Build Trust Through Transparency**: Create an immutable record of sessions, ratings, and payments
- **Empower Educators**: Give tutors direct control over their rates, schedules, and earnings
